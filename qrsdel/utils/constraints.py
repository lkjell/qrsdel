    This function provides an equivalent functionality to the *assert* builtin,
    but it cannot be disabled at compile time. It is very useful to check if a
    proposition is true, raising an *InconsistencyError* otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expression:
        Boolean expression. If it is True, the function does nothing, else it
        raises an InconsistencyError.
    messagestr:
        Optional message string to explain the generated exception, if it is
        the case.
    messageargs:
        List or tuple of arguments that are passed to the *format* method of
        messagestr. The string is only built if the exception is generated.
